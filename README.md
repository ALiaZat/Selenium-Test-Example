# SeleniumTestAlia
Hi ,  I have created three different testing scenarios for the pseu form , but there is a problem in the verion , and i did not know how to solve it ...
The first test scenario is to check that the check box can take multiple choices,
the second is to test that the radio button can take only one choice ,
and the last one to test the date field.
and i need to ask how  to write in the text field and test it .
